Brave Luna and the Midnight Storm
In a small village nestled by the sea, a young girl named Luna lived with her grandmother. Luna had always been fascinated by the ocean. Every evening, she would sit by the shore, listening to the waves and watching the sunset paint the sky in shades of orange and pink.
One stormy night, the villagers noticed the lighthouse on the cliff had gone dark. Without its light, sailors at sea were in grave danger. Luna, determined to help, grabbed her lantern and braved the howling wind and rain.
Climbing the steep, slippery path to the lighthouse, Luna thought of her late grandfather, the lighthouse keeper. She remembered his words: "When the sea is wild, the lighthouse stands strong."
Reaching the top, Luna found the lamp's wick soaked and useless. She quickly replaced it with fabric from her scarf and used the lantern's flame to relight the lamp. The lighthouse glowed once again, guiding the lost ships to safety.
When the storm passed, the villagers hailed Luna as their hero. She smiled humbly, knowing she had simply followed her heart.
