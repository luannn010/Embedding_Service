The Invisible Bridge
Far away in the mountains of Mistwood, there was a legendary bridge said to connect two peaks. However, the bridge was invisible, and only those who truly believed could cross it.
A young traveler named Elena came to the Mistwood, determined to find the bridge. The villagers warned her it was a fool's errand, but Elena had always trusted her instincts.
After days of searching, Elena stood at the edge of a cliff where the bridge was said to be. She took a deep breath and stepped forward. Her foot touched solid ground, though she could see nothing beneath her.
As Elena walked across the invisible bridge, the mist parted, revealing breathtaking views of the valley below. When she reached the other side, she found a crystal flower, proof of her bravery and belief.
Elena returned to the village, inspiring others to trust in themselves and take leaps of faith.
