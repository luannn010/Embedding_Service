The Golden Seed
Long ago, a wise king ruled a prosperous kingdom. One day, he decided to choose his successor, not through bloodline but by wisdom and integrity. He called upon all the children in the land and gave each one a single seed.
“Take this seed,” the king said, “and grow it into the most beautiful plant. In one year, I will judge your plants and choose my heir.”
A boy named Leo took his seed home and planted it in a pot. He watered it every day and placed it in sunlight, but nothing grew. While others boasted of their tall, blooming plants, Leo’s pot remained empty.
On the day of the contest, Leo hesitated but brought his empty pot to the palace. The king examined every pot and finally stopped at Leo’s.
“The seed I gave you was boiled and could not grow,” the king announced. “Leo is the only one who was honest and returned with the truth. He shall be my heir.”
